*** Installation

* dependencies:
- RDKit (www.rdkit.org)
- Matplotlib
- PyQt4

* The program was tested on Linux and Windows

* Set environment var SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS to the location where you want to store the SD files
- on Linux:
  # put this in your ~/.profile:
  SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS=/path/to/your/dir
  export SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS

  # save and close, then:
  $ source ~/.profile
  $ mkdir $SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS/sdf
  
Put the SD files you want to open into $SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS/sdf/ 
(if it does not exist it will be created on the first program run.)

If the program can not find SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS in the environment vars, the folder for the SDFs
defaults to $HOME/sdf_reports/sdf on Linux and %HOMEPATH%\sdf_reports\sdf on Windows and will be created if not present. This should also work on Windows.

cd into the extracted program folder and start the program by one of the following lines:
  $ ./sdf_viewer.py
  $ python2 sdf_viewer.py


*** Usage

* For the usage of the program, see also sdf_viewer.pdf, included in this folder (presented on RDKit UGM 2014).

* When performing fact searches, please remember that number field names are prefixed with "n_" 
  and text field names are prefixed with "s_". The program uses this to determine the plottable fields 
  and the fields that can be used for the "colorby" option. 
  - A search in the field that is displayed as "pIC50" in the table would therefore have to look 
    like this in the <query> entry field:  n_pIC50 >= 8
  - And a search in the text field "family" accordingly like this 
    (values are converted to lower-case in the text search):  "a.1" in s_family
  - field names beginning with "k_" (key, e.g. "k_molid") are used neither for plotting nor for coloring,
    but can be used in fact searching.
* Searches can be performed in the original sdf as well as in any other sublist derived from it by earlier searches.
  Just click on the respective entry in the table that lists all the search results 
  to make it the base for the next search. 

* The <open in browser> button is used to call a website for the displayed record.
  The function of the <open in browser> button can be defined in the <sdf_viewer_config.py> file (2 examples are given)
  - when defined, a url template is formatted with an sdf property (e.g. "k_molid") 
    and the url is passed to webbrowser.open(url)

* Saved sessions can be opened again under the name of the original sd file, e.g. when the original file was openend 
  as <ugm2014_bzr> (with or without <.sdf>) then the saved session can also be loaded as <ugm2014_bzr>.

  
*** Planned Improvements (many based on discussions during the RDKit UGM 2014)

[ ] combine search results with <or>
[ ] show molecule grid of selected records
[ ] include editable property ("s_remark")
[ ] rename property
[ ] select calculable properties
[ ] create some unit tests

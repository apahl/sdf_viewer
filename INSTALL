*** Installation

* dependencies:
- RDKit (http://rdkit.org)
- Matplotlib
- PyQt4

* The program was tested on Linux and Windows

* Set environment var SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS to the location where you want to store the SD files
- on Linux:
  # put this in your ~/.profile:
  SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS=/path/to/your/dir
  export SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS

  # save and close, then:
  $ source ~/.profile
  $ mkdir $SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS/sdf
  
Put the SD files you want to open into $SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS/sdf/ 
(if it does not exist it will be created on the first program run.)

If the program can not find SDF_VIEWER_REPORTS in the environment vars, the folder for the SDFs
defaults to $HOME/sdf_reports/sdf on Linux and %HOMEPATH%\sdf_reports\sdf on Windows and will be created if not present. This should also work on Windows.

cd into the extracted program folder and start the program by one of the following lines:
  $ ./sdf_viewer.py
  $ python2 sdf_viewer.py
